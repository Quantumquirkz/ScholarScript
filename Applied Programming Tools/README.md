In this section, you will find three tasks for developing C programs:

1. **Integer Comparison:** Write a program that compares two integers entered by the user and determines which one is greater, smaller, or if they are equal.
2. **Age Classification:** Write a program that classifies a person's age into different categories: Child, Teenager, Adult, and Elderly.
3. **Parity Determination:** Write a program that determines whether an integer entered by the user is even or odd.
