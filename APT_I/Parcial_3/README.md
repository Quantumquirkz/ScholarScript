# Partial 3 - Building
**Due today at 11:59 PM**

## Instructions
Create a map of all the classrooms on a specific floor or building.

- If it's **Building 3**, you only need to make **1 floor** of your choice.
- If it's **Building 4**, you need to map **the entire building**.

Additionally, there must be a person or 'AI' that automatically navigates the map. The AI should choose its own direction, and the console must print its location.
