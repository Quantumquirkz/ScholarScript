# Lab 2

## Instructions

1. **Digit Sum:**
   Write a program that takes an integer as input and sums its digits. Use a `while` loop to extract each digit and a `for` loop to repeat the process if the sum of the digits has more than one digit.

2. **Sum with Limit:**
   Write a program that sums numbers entered by the user until the sum reaches a predefined limit, also set by the user. Use a `while` loop to keep asking the user for numbers and a `for` loop to validate if the entered number is positive.

3. **Guess the Number:**
   Write a program where the computer selects a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it. Use a `while` loop to allow the user to keep guessing until they get it right, and a `for` loop to count the number of attempts.
